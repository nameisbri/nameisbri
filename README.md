# Hello, I'm Gabriela! 👋

## 💫 About Me
Full-stack developer with a unique background blending 8 years of marketing experience with technical expertise. I'm passionate about creating user-centric applications with meaningful impact, particularly in health tech. Recently graduated from BrainStation's Software Engineering program, I'm now seeking remote/hybrid opportunities to build solutions that make a difference.

## 🚀 Current Focus: Health Tech Solutions
I'm developing [Discloser](https://github.com/nameisbri/discloser), a platform that securely manages and shares health information through:
- 🔒 Secure document handling with OCR extraction
- 📊 Data visualization and health metrics tracking
- 🔔 Smart notification systems and risk-based reminders
- 📱 Responsive design for seamless mobile experience
- ❤️ Privacy-first architecture and user experience
